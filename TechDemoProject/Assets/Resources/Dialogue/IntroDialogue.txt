So you're the chosen one?
The one to eliminate the corruption of this world?
Remember this hero....
"The greatest evil is within oneself"
The saints can be the most unholy \n while the most wicked of soul can be the purest of soul.
evil is the misuse of good. \n Good and evil are equals of the opposite..
Be careful hero. Thread safely and strike swiftly.
What should the stories call you hero? \n If you're not forgotten....
